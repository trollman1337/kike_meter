# Generating and Installing Flutter Release Builds

## This guide provides instructions for generating and installing release builds for a Flutter application.
Generating Release Builds
Prerequisites

    Flutter SDK: Ensure you have Flutter installed. Download it from flutter.dev.
    Build Tools: Ensure you have the necessary build tools installed for your platform.

## Build for Android

    Navigate to Your Flutter Project:

    bash
```
cd path/to/your/flutter_project
```

Build the APK:

bash
```
flutter build apk --release
```

This generates a release APK in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk.


## Build for iOS

    Open the iOS Project:

    bash

``` open ios/Runner.xcworkspace ```

Build the iOS App:

    Select the Generic iOS Device as the target device.
    Go to Product > Archive in Xcode to generate an .ipa file.

Alternatively, use the command line to build the iOS release:

bash

    flutter build ios --release

    This generates the iOS build in the ios/build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app directory.

## Build for Web

    Build the Web App:

    bash

    ```flutter build web```
   

Installing Release Builds
For Android

    adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

## For iOS

    Distribute the .ipa File:
        Use Xcode to upload the .ipa to TestFlight or distribute it through an ad-hoc method.

    Note: Installing iOS apps directly on a device outside of TestFlight usually requires special provisioning profiles and developer certificates.

## For Web

        Deploy the Web Build:
        Upload the contents of the build/web directory to your web server.

    
## Additional Notes

    Ensure you have set up all necessary provisioning profiles and signing certificates for iOS builds.
    For detailed instructions on code signing and app distribution, refer to the Flutter documentation.
