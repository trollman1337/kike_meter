# Generating and Installing Flutter Release Builds

## This guide provides instructions for generating and installing release builds for a Flutter application.
Generating Release Builds
Prerequisites

    Flutter SDK: Ensure you have Flutter installed. Download it from flutter.dev.
    Build Tools: Ensure you have the necessary build tools installed for your platform.

1. Build for Android

    Navigate to Your Flutter Project:

    bash

cd path/to/your/flutter_project

Build the APK:

bash

flutter build apk --release

This generates a release APK in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk.

(Optional) Build the AAB:

bash

    flutter build appbundle --release

    This generates an Android App Bundle in build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app.aab.

2. Build for iOS

    Open the iOS Project:

    bash

open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

Build the iOS App:

    Select the Generic iOS Device as the target device.
    Go to Product > Archive in Xcode to generate an .ipa file.

Alternatively, use the command line to build the iOS release:

bash

    flutter build ios --release

    This generates the iOS build in the ios/build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app directory.

3. Build for Web

    Build the Web App:

    bash

    flutter build web

    This generates the web build in the build/web directory.

Installing Release Builds
For Android

    Transfer the APK:
        Copy the app-release.apk to your Android device.

    Install the APK:
        Open the APK file on your device to install it.

    Alternatively, use ADB to install:

    bash

    adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

## For iOS

    Distribute the .ipa File:
        Use Xcode to upload the .ipa to TestFlight or distribute it through an ad-hoc method.

    Note: Installing iOS apps directly on a device outside of TestFlight usually requires special provisioning profiles and developer certificates.

## For Web

    Deploy the Web Build:
        Upload the contents of the build/web directory to your web server.

## Additional Notes

    Ensure you have set up all necessary provisioning profiles and signing certificates for iOS builds.
    For detailed instructions on code signing and app distribution, refer to the Flutter documentation.
